I decoupled from theoretical physics and moved into research computing after completing my Ph.D in 2022. Since then, 
I have been working at the Instite of Cancer Research, London, developing scientific software, tools and applications
to support the research efforts of the organization.

I often find myself combing through the depths of stackoverflow and assimilating information from a variety of
