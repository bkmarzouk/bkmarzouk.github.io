# Hello!

I’m Kareem 👋, a research engineer and software developer based in London.

I work across the R&D tech stack, from building APIs and designing data pipelines to developing specialist research software. I’m a generalist at heart: I like to understand problems holistically, then dive as deep as needed to solve them (and sometimes deeper, just for fun).

My background spans regenerative agriculture, cancer research, and theoretical cosmology. Along the way, I’ve worked on problems involving data science, statistics, numerical simulation, and data infrastructure.

If you’re working on something interesting and need someone who can bridge research and engineering, we’ll probably get along!
