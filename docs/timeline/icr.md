**Research Software Engineer**

I worked on data, software, and HPC supporting cancer research as part of a centralised computing team, building shared systems researchers could depend on and collaborating directly with labs on their projects.

I built pipelines that automated transfers from lab instruments to research servers, so datasets reached researchers faster and more reliably. I also developed a modular genome analysis framework that replaced ad-hoc scripts with tested, configurable components and introduced more statistically robust methods.

I also helped maintain the shared HPC software environment, troubleshoot parallel workloads, and set up a centralised deployment framework for internal apps that simplified releases and reduced operational overhead.
