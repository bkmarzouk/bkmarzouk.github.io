**Research Software Engineer**

I work on the technology behind Europe’s largest arable carbon project, helping measure how greener agricultural practices affect carbon emissions and removals — and turning those measurements into credible carbon credits.

My work spans much of the modelling pipeline: building and maintaining carbon models, reconciling heterogeneous data sources with model requirements, and preparing historical datasets using statistical imputation that meets market standards.

It’s a cross-disciplinary role where data, science, and engineering constantly overlap. I also build API services and internal tooling to support product teams when business needs shift.
