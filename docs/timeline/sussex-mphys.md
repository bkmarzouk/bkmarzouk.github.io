**MPhys Theoretical Physics**

I completed an integrated master’s degree in theoretical physics.

During my studies, I was awarded a Junior Research Associate position that funded a summer astronomy project and gave me early experience building numerical software in a research setting. That experience largely motivated my subsequent PhD.
