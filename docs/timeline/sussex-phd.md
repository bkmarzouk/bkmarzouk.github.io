**Doctoral Researcher in Cosmology**

I did my PhD in cosmology, studying how models of the early universe leave signatures in observational data. My work focused on connecting theory to measurements, using statistics and simulation to test ideas about how the universe began.

I built simulation and sampling tools in Python and C++ for large Monte Carlo analyses, and developed data inference pipelines that ran on HPC clusters and processed hundreds of gigabytes of telescope and simulation data. This work fed into analyses of Planck satellite data and helped place tighter constraints on cosmological signals.

This is where I learned to work comfortably at the boundary of theory, data, and computation, often dealing with high-dimensional models with thousands of parameters where careful statistical thinking and efficient computation were essential. Alongside research, I TA’d undergraduate maths courses, which sharpened my ability to explain technical ideas clearly.
